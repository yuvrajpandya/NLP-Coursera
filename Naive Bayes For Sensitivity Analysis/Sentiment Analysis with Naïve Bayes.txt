Bayes Rule: Conditional Probabilities


P(X|Y) = P(Y|X) * P(X)/P(Y)

Derivation: 

P(Positive|"happy") = P(Positive ∩ "happy") / P("happy") ...Equation A

P("happy"|Positive) = P("happy" ∩ Positive) / P(Positive) ...Equation B

Substituting P("happy" ∩ Positive) in Equation A: Note that the intersections P("happy" ∩ Positive) & P(Positive ∩ "happy") are the same.

P(Positive|"happy") = P("happy"|Positive)*P(Positive)/P("happy")

-------------------------------------------------------------------


Suppose that in your dataset, 25% of the positive tweets contain the word ‘happy’. 
You also know that a total of 13% of the tweets in your dataset contain the word 'happy', 
and that 40% of the total number of tweets are positive. You observe the tweet: ''happy to learn NLP'. 
What is the probability that this tweet is positive?


P(Positive|"happy") = P("happy"|Positive) * P(Positive)/P("happy") = 0.25 * 0.4/0.13 = 0.77


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Naive Bayes:

likelihood score formula: for each word, calcualte the ratio in positive and negative class

For all words in the tweet, calcualte the likelihood score: e.g.: I am happy today;I am learning.

m
π   P(word_i|Positive)/P(word_i|Negative) ... where π is a pi notation (product notation -- repeated multiplication)
i=1

Probabilities of each word in each class is given as: word "I" probability in Positive as well as Negative tweet is 0.20

I = 0.20/0.20 , am = 0.20/0.20 , happy = 0.14/0.10, today = not found in the vocabulary so no probability, learning = 0.10/0.10
     I			am			happy		I			am			learning
(0.20/0.20)*(0.20/0.20)*(0.14/0.10)*(0.20/0.20)*(0.20/0.20)*(0.10/0.10) == 0.14/0.10 (all other terms are cancelled out) = 1.4 > 1 hence it is a Positive tweet!


NOTICE: that the word "today" is an unseen word and during the vocabulary building in training phase we did not encounter this word in the entire corpus. hence it is ignored.

Laplacian smoothing technique: bettering the Naive Bayes formula!!!

technique to use to avoid your probabilities being zero. 
e.g.: what if a word, say "because", appears only in Positive corpora. The P("because"|Negative) will be 0 which will throw off the likelihood score!
To avoid this we would add +1 in the numerator & V (# number of words in the vocabulary)

In the above formula, the probability of a word appearing in a class is replaced with this formula:

P(word|class) = (P(word|class)+1) / (sum of frequencies of all words in class + V)  ..... V is # number of words in the vocabulary
e.g.: "happy" in Positive class

P("happy"|Positive) = (0.20 + 1) / (13 + 8) = 0.057 .. 13 is sum of frequencies of all words appearing in Positive class & 8 is unique words in vocabulary

----------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision threshold: The likelihood score will range from 0 to +♾

if the score is between 0 to 1 : classify the tweet as Negative
if the score is > 1 : classify the tweet as Positive ------------> score of 1 is the decision threshold!!!

Note the scale is not uniform. For positive tweets, the scale goes upto +♾

Also, during the product/multiplication operation of the small ratios -> we might encounter numerical "underflow" 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log likelihood score:

To avoid the problem of numerical underflow & to have a normalized score scale, let's take the natural log of the ratios

log likelihood score = Σ log P(word|Positive)/P(word|Negative) ---- sum of log of probability ratios of the words in each class

The score scale will range from -♾ to +♾ | scores greater than 0 are positive tweets & lesser than 0 are negative tweets
